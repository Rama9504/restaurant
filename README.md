This Django-based web application encompasses distinct functionalities tailored for various user roles: customers, restaurant admins, and delivery personnel, facilitating seamless interaction among them. The application orchestrates a comprehensive user journey, from registration to order placement and delivery confirmation.

The "Sapp" app caters to customer needs, managing essential backend processes such as registration, email verification, login, cart management, address submission, order placement, and real-time order tracking. Customers can review their ordered items and modify their delivery address before finalizing the order.

On the other hand, the "Adminapp" empowers restaurant administrators to oversee operations efficiently. They have control over assigning delivery personnel, managing menu items (including availability, prices, and discounts), adding/removing delivery personnel, and adjusting their availability based on demand.

Lastly, the "Deliveryapp" serves delivery personnel, providing them with dedicated accounts. They receive order notifications, execute delivery tasks, and confirm delivery by submitting a verification code sent to the customer's registered email. If the code matches, the order is marked as delivered; otherwise, the correct code must be entered for validation.
